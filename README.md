# Artistly

A fictional *Performing Artist Booking Platform* built as part of a React + Next.js Frontend Developer Test Assignment. The platform connects **Event Planners** and **Artist Managers**, allowing event planners to browse artist profiles, filter by categories, and raise booking requests, while artist managers can onboard artists and manage submissions via a dashboard.

This project is built using **Next.js (v13+ App Router)**, **React Functional Components**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ShadCN UI components**. It is deployed on **Vercel** for live preview.

## Features

- **Homepage:** Platform overview with a hero section, artist category cards, and navigation.
- **Artist Listing Page:** Grid layout with filtering by category, location, and price range.
